# NeighBoards

This is a work in progress :) 

Neighboards is a web-based project management tool that allows teams to manage their projects and collaborate more effectively. Inspired by AzureBoards, Neighboards is designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use, while providing all the features needed for effective project management.

## Features

- Kanban board: Track the status of your project tasks using a kanban board. Move tasks between different stages of completion, assign tasks to team members, and add comments and attachments to each task.
- Backlog: Create and prioritize a backlog of tasks that are not yet in progress. Easily move tasks from the backlog to the kanban board when they are ready to be worked on.
- Sprint planning: Plan and track your project sprints using the sprint planning tool. Define sprint goals, estimate effort, and assign tasks to team members.
- Reporting: Generate reports on your project progress and performance. See how much work has been completed, how much work remains, and how long it's taking to complete each task.

## Technology stack

NeighBoards is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Firebase ( soon! ) : noSQL database
